So Heads Up No Limit Texas Holdem has really emerged in the AI community as a main benchmark for testing these application independent algorithms for imperfect information game solving. And this is a game that's actually played by humans. You don't see that much on TV or casinos because well, for various reasons, but you do see it in some expert level casinos and you see it in the best poker movies of all time. It's actually an event in the World Series of Poker, but mostly it's played online and typically for pretty big sums of money. And this is a game that usually only experts play. So if you go to your home game on a Friday night, it probably is not gonna be Heads Up No Limit Texas Holdem. It might be No Limit Texas Holdem in some cases, but typically for a big group and it's not as competitive. While Heads Up means it's two players. So it's really like me against you. Am I better or are you better? Much like chess or go in that sense, but an imperfect information game, which makes it much harder because I have to deal with issues of you knowing things that I don't know and I know things that you don't know instead of pieces being nicely laid on the board for both of us to see.\n",

We brought them in to Pittsburgh to play at the Reverse Casino for 20 days. We wanted to get 120,000 hands in because we wanted to get statistical significance. So it's a lot of hands for humans to play, even for these top pros who play fairly quickly normally. So we couldn't just have one of them play so many hands. 20 days, they were playing basically morning to evening. And I raised 200,000 as a little incentive for them to play. And the setting was so that they didn't all get 50,000. We actually paid them out based on how they did against the AI each. So they had an incentive to play as hard as they could, whether they're way ahead or way behind or right at the mark of beating the AI. And you don't make any money, unfortunately. Right, no, we can't make any money. So originally, a couple of years earlier, I actually explored whether we could actually play for money because that would be, of course, interesting as well, to play against the top people for money.

It's just that they've seen these top players, how good they are, and they're really fantastic. So it's just hard to believe that an AI could beat them. So I think that's where that comes from. And that's actually maybe a more general lesson about AI. That until you've seen it overperform a human, it's hard to believe that it could. But then the tells, a lot of these top players, they're so good at hiding tells that among the top players, it's actually not really worth it for them to invest a lot of effort trying to find tells in each other because they're so good at hiding them. So yes, at the kind of Friday evening game, tells are gonna be a huge thing. You can read other people. And if you're a good reader, you'll read them like an open book.

And sort of the way you're talking about where it's learning an evaluation function, but in imperfect information games, unlike let's say in Go or now also in chess and shogi, it's not sufficient to learn an evaluation for a state because the value of an information set depends not only on the exact state, but it also depends on both players beliefs. Like if I have a bad hand, I'm much better off if the opponent thinks I have a good hand and vice versa. If I have a good hand, I'm much better off if the opponent believes I have a bad hand. So the value of a state is not just a function of the cards. It depends on, if you will, the path of play, but only to the extent that it's captured in the belief distributions. So that's why it's not as simple as it is in perfect information games. And I don't wanna say it's simple there either. It's of course very complicated computationally there too, but at least conceptually, it's very straightforward. There's a state, there's an evaluation function. You can try to learn it. Here, you have to do something more. And what we do is in one of these papers, we're looking at where we allow the opponent to actually take different strategies at the leaf of the search tree, if you will. And that is a different way of doing it. And it doesn't assume therefore a particular way that the opponent plays, but it allows the opponent to choose from a set of different continuation strategies. And that forces us to not be too optimistic in a look ahead search. And that's one way you can do sound look ahead search in imperfect information games, which is very difficult. And you were asking about DeepStack. What they did, it was very different than what we do, either in Libratus or in this new work. They were randomly generating various situations in the game. Then they were doing the look ahead from there to the end of the game, as if that was the start of a different game. And then they were using deep learning to learn those values of those states, but the states were not just the physical states. They include belief distributions.\n"

And these are pairs of strategies where strategies are contingency plans, one for each player. So that neither player wants to deviate to a different strategy, given that the other doesn't deviate. But as a side effect, you get the beliefs from base roll. So Nash equilibrium really isn't just deriving in these imperfect information games, Nash equilibrium, it doesn't just define strategies. It also defines beliefs for both of us and defines beliefs for each state. So at each state, it's called information sets.

      "speech: So let me start from the basics. So a repeated game is a game where the same exact game is played over and over. In these extensive form games, where it's, think about three form, maybe with these information sets to represent incomplete information, you can have kind of repetitive interactions. Even repeated games are a special case of that, by the way. But the game doesn't have to be exactly the same. It's like in sourcing auctions. Yes, we're gonna see the same supply base year to year, but what I'm buying is a little different every time. And the supply base is a little different every time and so on. So it's not really repeated. So to find a purely repeated game is actually very rare in the world. So they're really a very course model of what's going on. Then if you move up from just repeated, simple repeated matrix games, not all the way to extensive form games, but in between, they're stochastic games, where, you know, there's these, you think about it like these little matrix games. And when you take an action and your opponent takes an action, they determine not which next state I'm going to, next game I'm going to, but the distribution over next games where I might be going to. So that's the stochastic game. But it's like matrix games, repeated stochastic games, extensive form games. That is from less to more general. And poker is an example of the last one. So it's really in the most general setting. Extensive form games. And that's kind of what the AI community has been working on and being benchmarked on with this Heads Up No Limit Texas Holdem.\n",

      "speech: Versus a matrix, yeah. And the matrix is called the matrix form or bi matrix form or normal form game. And here you have the tree form. So you can actually do certain types of reasoning there that you lose the information when you go to normal form. There's a certain form of equivalence. Like if you go from tree form and you say it, every possible contingency plan is a strategy. Then I can actually go back to the normal form, but I lose some information from the lack of sequentiality. Then the multiplayer versus two player distinction is an important one. So two player games in zero sum are conceptually easier and computationally easier. They're still huge like this one, but they're conceptually easier and computationally easier in that conceptually, you don't have to worry about which equilibrium is the other guy going to play when there are multiple, because any equilibrium strategy is a best response to any other equilibrium strategy. So I can play a different equilibrium from you and we'll still get the right values of the game. That falls apart even with two players when you have general sum games. Even without cooperation just in general. Even without cooperation. So there's a big gap from two player zero sum to two player general sum or even to three player zero sum.

And you've done this amazing work with mechanism design, designing games that have certain outcomes. But, so I'll tell you an example from my world of autonomous vehicles, right? We're studying pedestrians, and pedestrians and cars negotiate in this nonverbal communication. There's this weird game dance of tension where pedestrians are basically saying, I trust that you won't kill me, and so as a jaywalker, I will step onto the road even though I'm breaking the law, and there's this tension. And the question is, we really don't know how to model that well in trying to model intent. And so people sometimes bring up ideas of game theory and so on.

So let's say that you have fleets of autonomous cars operating by different companies. So maybe here's the Waymo fleet and here's the Uber fleet. If you think about the rules of the road, they define certain legal rules, but that still leaves a huge strategy space open. Like as a simple example, when cars merge, how humans merge, they slow down and look at each other and try to merge. Wouldn't it be better if these situations would already be prenegotiated so we can actually merge at full speed and we know that this is the situation, this is how we do it, and it's all gonna be faster.

      "speech: Yeah, so that's a good question. So there's so much to say about it. I do like this type of performance oriented research. Although in my group, we go all the way from like idea to theory, to experiments, to big system building, to commercialization, so we span that spectrum. But I think that in a lot of situations in AI, you really have to build the big systems and evaluate them at scale before you know what works and doesn't. And we've seen that in the computational game theory community, that there are a lot of techniques that look good in the small, but then they cease to look good in the large. And we've also seen that there are a lot of techniques that look superior in theory. And I really mean in terms of convergence rates, like first order methods, better convergence rates, like the CFR based algorithms, yet the CFR based algorithms are the fastest in practice. So it really tells me that you have to test this in reality. The theory isn't tight enough, if you will, to tell you which algorithms are better than the others. And you have to look at these things in the large, because any sort of projections you do from the small can at least in this domain be very misleading. So that's kind of from a kind of a science and engineering perspective, from a personal perspective, it's been just a wild experience in that with the first poker competition, the first brains versus AI, man machine poker competition that we organized. There had been, by the way, for other poker games, there had been previous competitions, but this was for Heads Up No Limit, this was the first. And I probably became the most hated person in the world of poker. And I didn't mean to, I just saw. Why is that? For cracking the game, for something. Yeah, a lot of people felt that it was a real threat to the whole game, the whole existence of the game. If AI becomes better than humans, people would be scared to play poker because there are these superhuman AIs running around taking their money and all of that. So I just, it's just really aggressive. The comments were super aggressive. I got everything just short of death threats.\n",

If you look, say, I don't know, at complexes like our political system, can we design our political system to have, in an automated fashion, to have outcomes that we want?

These are proofs that if you want to accomplish properties X in class C, that is not doable with any mechanism. The good thing about automated mechanism design is that we're not really designing for a class. We're designing for specific settings at a time. So even if there's an impossibility result for the whole class, it just doesn't mean that all of the cases in the class are impossible. It just means that some of the cases are impossible. So we can actually carve these islands of possibility within these known impossible classes. And we've actually done that. So one of the famous results in mechanism design is the Meyerson Satethweight theorem by Roger Meyerson and Mark Satethweight from 1983. It's an impossibility of efficient trade under imperfect information. We show that you can, in many settings, avoid that and get efficient trade anyway.\n",

So one famous example of is the FCC spectrum auctions. So I've also had a small role in that and very good economists have been working, excellent economists have been working on that with no game theory, yet the rules that are designed in practice there, they're such that bidding truthfully is not the best strategy. Usually mechanism design, we try to make things easy for the participants.

So in machine learning, it's a fairly mature technology and it's very broadly applied and proven success in the real world. In game solving, there are almost no applications yet. We have just become superhuman, which machine learning you could argue happened in the 90s, if not earlier, and at least on supervised learning, certain complex supervised learning applications. Now, I think the next challenge problem, I know you're not asking about it this way, you're asking about the technology breakthrough, but I think that big, big breakthrough is to be able to show that, hey, maybe most of, let's say, military planning or most of business strategy will actually be done strategically using computational game theory.

You have a lot of people now running kidney exchanges and at the transplant centers, interacting with the kidney exchange. You have extra surgeons, nurses, anesthesiologists, hospitals, all of that. So employment is increasing from that and the world is becoming a better place. Another example is combinatorial sourcing auctions. We did 800 large scale combinatorial sourcing auctions from 2001 to 2010 in a previous startup of mine called CombineNet. And we increased the supply chain efficiency on that $60 billion of spend by 12.6%. So that's over $6 billion of efficiency improvement in the world.

The closest I've seen it was the following type of mental exercise really, where I had this argument in the late eighties when we were building these transportation optimization systems. And somebody had heard that it's a good idea to have high utilization of assets. So they told me, hey, why don't you put that as objective? And we didn't even put it as an objective because I just showed him that, if you had that as your objective, the solution would be to load your trucks full and drive in circles. Nothing would ever get delivered. You'd have a hundred percent utilization. So yeah, I know this phenomenon. I've known this for over 30 years, but I've never seen it actually be a problem in reality.

This makes the situation riskier now than it was maybe ever before.\"}\n",
