She launched a field of effective computing with her book of the same name, emphasizing the importance of emotion in artificial and natural intelligence. Emotional communication plays a vital role in the relationship between people in general and human-robot interaction. The conversation covers topics such as emotion, ethics, privacy, wearable computing, and her recent research in epilepsy, and even love and meaning. The conversation is part of the Artificial Intelligence Podcast hosted by Lex Friedman. More than 20 years ago, Rosalind Picard coined the term effective computing and led its development.'}, {'title': 'Affective Computing: Understanding and Adapting to Human Emotion ', 'text': 'Effective computing was termed and researched by the speaker more than 20 years ago. The goal of effective computing is to make machines detect and interpret the emotional state of a human being and adapt their behavior based on the emotional state. The original concept of affective computing was broader than just recognizing and responding to human emotion, and also encompassed machines that would have mechanisms functioning like human emotion inside them. Affective computing includes any computing that relates to, arises from, or deliberately influences human emotion.'}, {'title': 'The Influence of Human-Computer Interaction on Emotion ', 'text': 'Computing related to human emotion.

Clippy was a natural language processing tool that tried to help complete typing. Some people found Clippy annoying, while others liked it. Clippy's annoyance created a sense of companionship for some users. Clippy could have been improved by responding smarter to user reactions.\"}, {'title': 'Lack of Emotional Intelligence in AI Development ', 'text': \"The AI in question responded inappropriately to negative feedback, smiling, winking, and dancing instead of showing appropriate emotional intelligence. Bill Gates received a standing ovation when he announced the AI's departure, indicating people's frustration with its lack of emotional intelligence. The developers of the AI did not consider the importance of social and emotional interaction in their design. Intelligence at the time was focused on math, language, chess, and games, but lacked understanding of social and emotional interactions. Social and emotional interaction is much more complex than the problems the AI was designed to solve.\"}, {'title': 'The Complexity of Social Emotional Interaction ', 'text': 'Social emotional interaction is more complex than games like chess or Go.
