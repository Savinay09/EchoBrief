The podcast also criticizes and studies the labor crisis caused by the emergence of new AI industries and the particular set of skills required for the new jobs that many people may not have or want to have. It also addresses the potential environmental impact of the new jobs and the absence of many of the old jobs, and the debate over whether the old jobs were good for the environment and if they are missed. The podcast also discusses the potential use of AI to help farmers in drought-stricken areas, mitigate deforestation, and keep coral reefs healthy, but raises concerns about the effectiveness of AI technology in real-world applications and the lack of real input from the communities who will use and benefit from the technology. It also addresses the need for AI development to involve real input from users and be evaluated for their practical impact. The podcast also compares the level of criticism towards AI and crypto technologies, and raises doubts about the effectiveness of climate-related AI products in actually helping the planet and indigenous groups."}, {"title": "4. Ethical Considerations in Technology Development and Deployment", "summary": "The podcast discusses the issue of homelessness leading to human feces on the streets in San Francisco and the development of AI poop picking up robots by engineers in the Bay Area to address the problem. However, Dan Lyons suggests that public restrooms would be a better solution. The podcast emphasizes the importance of considering the impact of technical systems on people and ecologies, and the need for input from the community who will be impacted. It highlights the value of engaging with the community in the technology development process to gather insights and perspectives, and to identify potential problems before they become significant issues. The podcast also emphasizes the importance of thorough due diligence and ethical engagement with potential impacted communities, and the need to fully assess technology before deployment and design to address potential issues. It raises the question of whether technology should be developed and released at all, and how to weigh the cost and benefits, suggesting that non-technical solutions may be better for certain social problems. The example of homelessness in San Francisco is used to illustrate the limitations of technical solutions for social problems."}, {"title": "5. Addressing Bias and Discrimination in Tech Companies and AI", "summary": "The podcast discusses the ultimate goals of companies, which include getting acquired, getting venture capital, or leveraging the company into something larger. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the economics behind product development and the difference between creating a marketable product and solving a problem. The role of empirical findings and labor organizing in policy and legal strategies is also highlighted, with a focus on documenting the harms of algorithmic discrimination and advocating for changes to policy based on these documented harms. The podcast also addresses the impact of powerful companies on environmental and social harm, particularly in relation to the control that tech companies have over people's lives and the need for radical reformulation of the definition of a successful product or company. It emphasizes the importance of exerting pressure from different areas, including within tech companies, grassroots organizations, advocacy and civil rights organizations, legal advocacy groups, labor organizers, and academic researchers, as well as the essential input from the communities most impacted by these issues."}, {"title": "6. Understanding the Social and Environmental Impact of New Technology", "summary": "The podcast discusses the power dynamics in technology and the need to address them, particularly in terms of bringing marginalized communities into the conversation. It emphasizes the importance of collective empowerment to have more control over how technology is produced and used. The distinction between intentional harm and unintended harm caused by technology products is highlighted, with examples of how tech products can cause harm in unintended ways or through negligence. The value system of tech production may disregard the harm caused by the product, and examples of harm caused by tech products are provided, such as taking over jobs and disconnecting us from our immediate environment. The podcast also emphasizes the need for more historians in tech spaces to provide valuable insights into the history of technology and its connections to the present. It discusses the potential harms of the metaverse and the importance of understanding social dynamics and power structures when assessing potential harms of new technology. The podcast concludes by highlighting the importance of acknowledging societal issues such as racism, sexism, homophobia, and inequality when creating new technology, as building things without acknowledging these larger histories can lead to problems."}, {"title": "7. Ethical Implications of Using AI in Death and Resurrection", "summary": "The podcast discusses the importance of considering the narratives and histories of the past when developing present-day technological production. It highlights the potential burden that could be created for the living by using generative AI to resurrect the dead, as well as the human costs of preserving the data of the deceased. The financial burden of maintaining everyone's data in perpetuity is also addressed, along with the environmental impact of expanding data centers to support generative AI. The ethical implications of perpetuating relationships with the dead through technology, including the potential violation of the deceased person's wishes and the impact on their family members, are explored. The use of deepfake technology to revive dead celebrities and the ethical considerations surrounding this practice are also discussed. The podcast delves into the broader context of preserving data, particularly the data of the dead, and its impact on labor and environmental damage. It also explores how technology affects our understanding and experience of death, and how death disrupts the original plan for many technologies, such as social media platforms.
