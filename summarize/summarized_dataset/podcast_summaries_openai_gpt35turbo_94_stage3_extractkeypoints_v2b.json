GPT2: A Transformer with 1.5 Billion Parameters", "summary": "The podcast discusses the GPT2 transformer, a neural network with 1.5 billion parameters trained on 40 billion tokens of text. The transformer's success is attributed to its combination of multiple ideas, not just attention alone, and its ability to run efficiently on GPUs. There has been significant progress in GANs, but text generation has not progressed as much. Some cognitive scientists question the true understanding of language by GPT2 models. The size of language models is crucial for their performance, with larger models showing signs of understanding semantics. There is a disagreement with Noam Chomsky on the idea of taking incremental steps with a larger network and compute to reach semantics. Empirical evidence suggests that larger language models exhibit signs of understanding semantics, while smaller models do not. The theory is that as neural nets increase in size, they focus more on semantics than syntax. The implication is that larger neural nets focus on semantics.
