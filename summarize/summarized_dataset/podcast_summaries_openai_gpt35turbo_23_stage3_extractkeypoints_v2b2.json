The podcast also emphasizes the importance of supporting professionals in their work with AI, as AI can make professional tasks less tedious and time-consuming. Collaboration between human and machine is important for making the life of creatives easier. The podcast also highlights the importance of assisting users in the moment to do the task they need to do, and discusses research projects analyzing tutorials to provide inspiration for what to do next. The ultimate goal is to provide assistive suggestions for designers and creative people, combining domain understanding with AI and pattern matching to make intelligent suggestions. The podcast also discusses the importance of understanding different media types visually and in terms of transcripts and words, and the goal of removing the barrier of having to type in keywords for searching. Ultimately, the tool should assist with learning the interface, and the discussion revolves around whether an assistant modifies the interface to be simpler or just assists with learning the existing interface. Consideration is given to onboarding new users and how to make the interface easier for them, as some users value mastering a complex interface and keyboard shortcuts, while others prefer a more assistive version for quick and simple tasks."}, {"title": "4. Exciting Applications of Computer Vision and Machine Learning by Adobe", "summary": "Adobe is working on various applications of computer vision and machine learning, including scene stitching, sky replacement, foreground/background removal, spatial object-based image search, automatic image captioning, and more. These applications aim to streamline post-production workflows and provide more creative options for users. The technology also involves the use of neural networks and GANs to automatically remove objects from images and fill in the background. However, there are still challenges in achieving high-resolution and common sense knowledge in the algorithms, and further research is needed to improve their performance. The concept of an ensemble of experts specialized in certain tasks may be considered for improving the algorithm's performance."}, {"title": "5. The Importance of Sharing Data for Workflow Improvement", "summary": "In this podcast, the importance of sharing workflows and choices with the data set for training is discussed, as well as the technologies for learning without storing all information permanently. The willingness to share data with Adobe for improving workflow is compared to social networks, and the potential benefit of sharing data with Adobe for improving future workflow is highlighted. The need for protection of sensitive data in professional workflows, such as in legal cases, is also addressed, as well as the possibility of a more permissive relationship with Adobe for non-confidential projects. The podcast also delves into the potential of capturing high-level data from more people and detailed knowledge from willing participants, and the importance of explicit customer studies to gather feedback on the tool. It is emphasized that a more systematic process is needed to train an algorithm for customer studies, and a conscious effort is needed to balance data collection with customer trust. The role of Adobe's chief privacy officer in ensuring responsible data collection and making privacy a priority in AI development is also discussed. The podcast also touches on Project Puppetron, which demonstrates Adobe's move towards thinking in 3D, not just 2D, and the process of either voting on confidence in future actions or using a dispatcher to assign tasks based on expertise. It is noted that each model requires a significant amount of work, but over time, the set will be filled out and capabilities will increase. The focus initially will be on specific workflows, with expansion as capabilities grow, and the goal is to gather information on existing workflows and user needs, particularly in popular software like Photoshop. The aim is to understand the type of data needed for annotation and collection, such as specific objects like houses or octopus, and the significance of understanding the kind of data needed for annotation and collection for building effective tools in AI is highlighted. The podcast concludes by emphasizing the importance of training customers in using products and learning from them about what is important and useful, as well as the need to respect privacy and obtain explicit permission for data usage. Demonstrating the benefits of sharing data with the tool is also deemed necessary, either in understanding intent for better recommendations or for the quick evolution of the tool."}, {"title": "6.
