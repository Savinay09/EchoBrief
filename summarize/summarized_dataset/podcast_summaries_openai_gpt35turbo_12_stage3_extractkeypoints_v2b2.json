{"episode_number": "12", "title_and_summary_array": [{"title": "1. Thomas Sanholm: AI System Co-Creator, Game Theory Expert, and Poker Professor", "summary": "Thomas Sanholm, a professor at CMU and co-creator of Labratus, the first AI system to beat top human players in Heads Up No Limit Texas Holdem, has made significant contributions to game theory and machine learning. Texas Holdem is a game typically played by a big group and is not as competitive, but Heads Up No Limit Texas Holdem is a game between two players, making it more like a one-on-one competition. The game is an imperfect information game, making it much harder to play. In 2017, Labratus beat four expert human players in this game, raising questions about the process and what was learned from it. The AI, Libratus, was able to achieve an incredible accomplishment by defeating humans in a competition, despite people underestimating its performance. The importance of human perception and strategy in poker is questioned, as AI systems only focus on betting patterns and statistics. The skepticism about AI's ability to beat top human players in games and the difficulty in finding tells among top players due to their skill in hiding them is also discussed."}, {"title": "2. The Importance of Abstraction and Tells in Poker Strategy", "summary": "The podcast discusses the importance of tells in poker, especially at lower levels of play, and how they become less important at higher levels due to the larger number of strategies and possible actions involved. The game tree in poker is too large to solve directly, so abstraction is necessary, but this is more challenging in games than in other single agent scenarios. Abstraction in poker involves hands and betting strategies, as well as information and action abstraction. The algorithms used for information abstraction consider how hands might materialize over time, while action abstraction is based on past human and AI gameplay. The strength of the hand, information abstraction, and betting actions are all important factors in the game. Playing a lot of hands reduces the role of luck and variance in No Limit Texas Holdem, and over 100,000 hands are needed to get statistical significance in poker. The podcast also discusses the use of learning methods, such as deep learning, in poker gameplay, and the difficulty of sound look ahead search in imperfect information games. Overall, the podcast covers various techniques and approaches in game playing, including the use of deep learning to learn values of states and different search algorithms."}, {"title": "3. Understanding Nash Equilibrium and Probability Distribution in Game Theory", "summary": "The podcast discusses the concept of beliefs as output, not input, in game theory. It explains that beliefs are influenced by the rules of the game and the concept of Nash equilibrium, which defines rational play in games with multiple players. The text also highlights the role of Bayes' theorem in deriving beliefs and the use of opponent modeling in game theory. It emphasizes the importance of strategy in exploiting opponents and the impact of irrational behavior on game outcomes. The podcast also explores the concept of hybrid strategies and the approach to repeated games. Overall, it provides insights into the strategic and rational aspects of game theory in decision-making."}, {"title": "4. Analyzing Repeated Games and Collusion in Multiplayer Games", "summary": "The podcast discusses different types of games, including matrix games, stochastic games, and extensive form games. It explains that repeated games are a special case of extensive form games and are played over and over. The text compares the tree form of games, such as chess, with the matrix form or bi matrix form of games. It discusses the difference between two player zero sum games and two player general sum games, as well as the concept of Nash equilibrium. The speaker also talks about collusion in games and the ethical issues it raises, as well as the challenges it presents for AI methods. The speaker has done a lot of work on coalitional games and has introduced a new game representation for dealing with collusion. There are still some unknowns in this area, and the speaker mentions the game of bridge as an example."}, {"title": "5. Game Theoretic Reasoning in Business, Security, and Human Behavior Modeling", "summary": "The podcast discusses the importance of coordination in games like bridge, where strategies must be coordinated ahead of time without the ability to communicate during the game. It explores the use of signals in games like bridge and how coordination is built into the rules of some games but not in others, such as auctions, negotiations, and diplomatic relationships. The podcast also delves into the application of game theory and negotiation strategies in various fields beyond poker, including business, military security, cyber security, and intelligence. It introduces two startup companies, Strategic Machine and Strategy Robot, which focus on different applications of game theoretic reasoning technologies. The podcast also discusses the challenges of modeling human behavior in pedestrian-car interactions in the world of autonomous vehicles and the potential application of automated negotiation to manage fleets of autonomous cars operated by different companies. Overall, the podcast highlights the significance of coordination and negotiation strategies in various real-world applications and the potential use of game theory and AI in addressing these challenges."}, {"title": "6. The Impact of AI Advancements in Poker and Engineering", "summary": "The podcast discusses the first competition for Heads Up No Limit poker, where the speaker became the most hated person in the world of poker due to their involvement in AI cracking the game. Many people felt that AI was a real threat to the existence of the game, and the speaker received aggressive comments and death threats. However, the speaker believes that humans can still enjoy the game of poker despite AI outperforming them in chess. The AIs have changed how the game of poker is played, and the top humans are now incorporating the AIs' strategies into their own play. The AIs have made poker a richer and more interesting game for humans to play, and the speaker has learned to love the game of poker through working with AIs. The speaker did not intend to \"kill the game\" of poker and believes that the AIs have not steered humans away from the game entirely. The podcast also delves into the engineering and scientific effort of AI to beat human players, emphasizing the importance of testing algorithms in reality to determine their effectiveness. The speaker has had a wild experience with organizing the first brains versus AI poker competition."}, {"title": "7. Automated Mechanism Design in Politics and Various Fields", "summary": "The podcast discusses the challenges of implementing good ideas at scale, emphasizing the importance of real-world application and the limitations of mechanism design. It explores the concept of automated mechanism design and its potential application in designing political systems. The speaker acknowledges the impossibility results in mechanism design but highlights the possibility of achieving specific outcomes within known impossible classes. The podcast also touches on the limited success of mechanism design in real-world situations, using the example of FCC spectrum auctions to illustrate the challenges of truth-telling in high-stakes auctions.
